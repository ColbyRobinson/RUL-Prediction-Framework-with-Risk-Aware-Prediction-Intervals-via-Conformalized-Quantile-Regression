# RUL-Prediction-Framework-with-Risk-Aware-Prediction-Intervals-via-Conformalized-Quantile-Regression
This repository contains the code for the IJPHM paper submission: Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Aircraft Engines with Risk-Aware Prediction Intervals via Conformalized Quantile Regression, written by Colby Don Robinson.

The paper introduces a remaining useful life prediction framework for aircraft engines that jointly addresses point estimation, uncertainty quantification, and the integration of aerospace risk preferences to advance decision support for safety-critical maintenance. The framework is evaluated on all four subsets of NASA's C-MAPSS benchmark dataset.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new virtual environment and install the requirements or environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate rul_cmapss
```
or
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the virtual environment and run:
```   
 Run command will be added after the notebooks are modularized into .py scripts
```
